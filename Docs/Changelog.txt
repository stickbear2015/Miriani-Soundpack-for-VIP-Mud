Version 5.9.38, released 2018-05-21:
* Added more ship classes to the NIRP extra. It should be able to recognize most ship classes now, although I'm not sure if the speed values are very accurate. Feel free to report if something seems a little bit off. The soundpack will now also remember the speed value across sessions. Thanks to Kendle for being an eager helper. It was the motivation I needed to make this change!

Version 5.9.37, released 2018-05-20:
* Added a NIRP extra that calculates ETA for your destinations. After enabling this extra by typing conf x nirp, you can set the average travel speed using the SetSpeed command. Alternatively you can use the ABOUT command, and the soundpack will attempt to guess the speed for you based on the ship class. Only transversers are recognized at this point, and it assumes that transversers can make 80 sectors per hour. P.S. VIP Mud whines about bad expression if the result of a division operation is greater than 32767. Therefore it might break if the ratio between distance and speed is too large. I added a few conditions to help prevent some of these cases, but it's still possible to cause errors if you play with great distances and/or low speed values. P.P.S. Because VIP Mud doesn't even support numbers with fractions, I had to invent some more bullshit routines to make this work. It may or may not cause weird bugs. Let's hope GMA Games will one day release a version of VIP Mud that is capable of reliably performing basic arithmetic operations.

Version 5.9.36, released 2018-03-15:
* Addressed an error that could pop up in some instances when aiming at starships. Thanks Anara Webster for reporting this!

Version 5.9.35, released 2018-02-11:
* Changed the post extra so that it won't overwrite the current message unless you type post new.
* Fixed the letter y weirdly appearing in external PA messages sometimes.

Version 5.9.34, released 2017-12-28:
* Improved the way the archaeology framework handles output from directional scanners when conf gadget 8 is off.
* Changed the room title formatter so that coordinates are displayed first in dynamic rooms (like dig sites and asteroids). Thanks Beatrice for bringing this to my attention. I'm sorry it took so long to get this done.

Version 5.9.33, released 2017-12-28:
* Fixed a bug with default and current values in choice based conf options.
* Changing binary conf options without going through the menus will now indicate the title of the option you're adjusting.

Version 5.9.32, released 2017-12-28:
* Added an option for showing digging depth in archaeology. It can be found in conf gadgets.

Version 5.9.31, released 2017-12-21:
* Added a post extra that makes it easier to post messages from a text editor like Notepad. It can be enabled using conf x post, and the command to use it is just POST.

Version 5.9.30, released 2017-12-18:
* Fixed an issue that caused a lot of errors if the script path or the sounds path contained any at symbols. You might need to reinstall the soundpack for this fix to take effect (if this was an issue for you in the first place). The linking scripts have been updated, although the most recent linking script for sounds have not been uploaded to the zip file for sounds yet. I included them in the zip file for the soundpack itself for now, so just copy them from there into your Miriani Sounds folder for now.

Version 5.9.29, released 2017-12-06:
* The soundpack will now respect room-o 22, but it will only say if a room is outdoors. Indoors is implied by the lack of outdoors.

Version 5.9.28, released 2017-12-05:
* Fixed a bug that preventedd the soundpack from differentiating between indoor and outdoor rooms.

Version 5.9.27, released 2017-12-04:
* Starmap filters should now work in observation centers too. Hopefully.

Version 5.9.26, released 2017-12-03:
* Fixed issues with asteroid rovers. Now it should display the coordinates you move to, as well as processing the possible exits properly.

Version 5.9.25, released 2017-12-03:
* Added support for the jet black Santa boxes. Super squeezy hugs to Tom Tucker for contributing fully functional code for this. Thaaanks!

Version 5.9.24, released 2017-12-03:
* Possibly fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in the starship detected sound being played when looking at the starmap.

Version 5.9.23, released 2017-11-19:
* The scan filter for starships now includes org tags. Unfortunately I had to reset all scan filter formatters to their default values, so you may need to reconfigure your scan filters if you don't like those default settings.

Version 5.9.22, released 2017-11-12:
* Fixed ammo unload sound being triggered by the room description at Outreach Mineral Processor Docking Bay. Thank you Anny Rain for reporting this.

Version 5.9.21, released 2017-11-10:
* Fixed virtual display configurations not migrating correctly from 1.1 to 2.0.

Version 5.9.20, released 2017-10-29:
* Shortened the message you see when you start walking using the WALK command.

Version 5.9.19, released 2017-10-29:
* Fixed an error when using medical bays. Thanks to Moiraine Soto for reporting this.

Version 5.9.18, released 2017-10-29:
* Made the start and end of streamed board posts less verbose.

Version 5.9.17, released 2017-10-29:
* Added the starship detected sound for when you scan an asteroid that has one or more starships on it. Thanks to Amy Draksen for suggesting this.

Version 5.9.16, released 2017-10-22:
* Changed repair messages. The ETA command will now show the time first, and the CHECK command will show the amount of damage first.

Version 5.9.15, released 2017-10-21:
* Improved the focus output formatter string. Now it supports X, Y, and Z. It has also been moved from conf scan to conf ship. Furthermore, instead of showing the word unchanged, it will now beep when the coordinates change.

Version 5.9.14, released 2017-10-21:
* Fixed an oversight in the ship computer framework that prevented it from playing the control room report sound sometimes.

Version 5.9.13, released 2017-10-19:
* Merged the list of actions into the list of socials, since it's all just socials anyway. This also gives a little performance boost, since I could remove alot of duplicated code.

Version 5.9.12, released 2017-10-19:
* Added sound support for emotes. Remember to enable emotes in conf socials if you turned it off in a previous life.

Version 5.9.11, released 2017-10-19:
* Fixed certain starmap titles not being gagged when using starmap filters. Thanks Michael Calaway for reporting this!

Version 5.9.10, released 2017-10-18:
* Now it will also recognize vacuum-sealed packets of frozen food resembling star-shaped cookies. Hurray!

Version 5.9.9, released 2017-10-18:
* The soundpack will now attempt to be extra informational when you snatch artifacts from space. Maybe this will work when you look at artifacts too. Who knows.

Version 5.9.8, released 2017-10-18:
* SmFilters will try harder to avoid gagging things they shouldn't gag.

Version 5.9.7, released 2017-10-16:
* Cleaned up some legacy code related to speech types that was only relevant in VIP Mud 1.1. Speech types in VIP Mud 2.0 can be either None, Sapi, or Screen reader.

Version 5.9.6, released 2017-10-15:
* Removed the entire experience level framework. It might make the soundpack slightly faster, and maybe it will also help bypassing the bug in VIP Mud that prevents aliases and keystrokes from being loaded properly.

Version 5.9.5, released 2017-10-14:
* Fixed a small bug with how conf exp 2 treated messages about lights flashing overhead.

Version 5.9.4, released 2017-10-08:
* Removed the conf option to have variables expanded in the entry window, since it served no purpose other than to fuck up things for people. As a consequence, I also removed conf vip, since there was only one option left in there and I thought it would be better to just move it to conf gen.

Version 5.9.3, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed SPTest not working. Thanks Cria for reporting this.

Version 5.9.2, released 2017-10-08:
* The prod social will now produce the same sound as the poke social.

Version 5.9.1, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed a bug in the conf loader that meant class states for socials, actions, and emotes weren't updated when using conf load.

Version 5.9.0, released 2017-10-08:
* For 2.0: Redesigned the soundpack loading framework. Hopefully the new one is a little bit faster and more stable. There might be a few new bugs though as a result of this change, but feel free to report them through appropriate channels, such as the soundpack metaf, or the soundpack board.
* For 2.0: Removed the option to save configuration when idle, since it's just unnecessary. The option to auto save on exit is much better.
* For 1.1: Officially discontinuing to maintain the soundpack for 1.1. Future updates will apply for 2.0 only, unless changelog entries indicate otherwise. The SP for 1.1 will no longer notify you of soundpack updates.

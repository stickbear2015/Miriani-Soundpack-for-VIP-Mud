... and much more!

## Installation instructions for Proxiani
Just three simple steps:

1. Download and install Node.js.
You can get the latest version of NodeJS from:
https://nodejs.org/
Choose the latest recommended version for Windows.
Normal typical installation of NodeJS and other pre-selected features will do.

2. Download and start Proxiani.
You can download the latest version of Proxiani from:
https://github.com/tms88/proxiani/archive/master.zip
Unzip the package into a folder of your choice.
In this folder you'll find a bunch of files, including a file called Start.vbs.
Hit the Enter key on Start.vbs, and it will silently run Proxiani in the background.

3. Open up VIP Mud, and either add a new character or edit an existing character for Miriani.
The only thing to change here is hostname.
For Proxiani, you need to use localhost as hostname instead of toastsoft.net.
Port number is still the same, either 1234 or 1236.

And that's it!
If you want Proxiani to start automatically after restarting your computer, then
Run the script called Enable Auto Start.vbs, which is located in the same folder where you found Start.vbs.
If you ever move this Proxiani folder to a different location on your computer, then
You will need to Enable Auto Start from the new location by hitting Enter on that file again.

You can send questions and comments to the soundpack metaf in game, frequency 372.8.
Happy days!
